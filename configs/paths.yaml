# DEPRECATED: This file is deprecated in favor of configs/config.yaml
# All path configurations have been moved to the main config.yaml file
# This file is kept for backward compatibility only and will be removed in future versions

# Please use configs/config.yaml for all configuration management
# The paths section in config.yaml contains all path configurations

# For reference, paths are now structured as:
# paths:
#   data_dir: data
#   results_dir: results
#   plots_dir: plots
#   ... (see config.yaml for complete list)
